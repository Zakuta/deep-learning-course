# deep-learning-visual-recognition

This is a repository is a part of Deep Learning for Visual Recognition course offered at University of Bonn. Here we implement different deep learning models and validate them for visual recognition tasks such as object classification.

## Assignment Overview


* [Assignment 1: k-nearest neighbor and linear regression on MNIST](https://github.com/Zakuta/deep-learning-course/tree/master/assignment01)
	
	This assignment is a simple introduction to machine learning methods. We implement two algorithms k-nearest neighbor classifier and linear regression. For evaluation we use MNIST dataset.

* [Assignment 2: MLP on MNIST and ORL Dataset](https://github.com/Zakuta/deep-learning-course/tree/master/assignment02)
	
	In this exercise, we implement MLP using pyTorch and use it to classify MNIST dataset and ORL database of faces.

* [Assignment 3: MLP with SGD and Nesterov Momentum](https://github.com/Zakuta/deep-learning-course/tree/master/assignment03)

* [Assignment 4: CNN for face classification](https://github.com/Zakuta/deep-learning-course/tree/master/assignment04)

* [DCGAN-project](https://github.com/Zakuta/deep-learning-course/tree/master/DCGAN-project)

	We train a deep convolutional generative adversial network following [Radford et al. (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) and produce results akin mentioned in it.
