# deep-learning-visual-recognition

This is a repository, under implementation as a part of Deep Learning for Visual Recognition course offered at University of Bonn. Here we implement different deep learning models and validate them for visual recognition tasks such as object classification.

## Assignment Overview


* Assignment 1: k-nearest neighbor and linear regression on MNIST
	
	This assignment is a simple introduction to machine learning methods. We implement two algorithms k-nearest neighbor classifier and linear regression. For evaluation we use MNIST dataset.

* Assignment 2: MLP on MNIST and ORL Dataset
	
	In this exercise we implement MLP using pytorch and use it to classify MNIST dataset and ORL database of faces.

* Assignment 3: MLP with SGD and Nesterov Momentum

* Assignment 4: CNN for face classification
